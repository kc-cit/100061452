		<h1>The degree plan I am pursuing is in Networking & Cybsersecurity</h2>
		
		<p>The most interesting topics so far are the ones that involve networking and how they connect to web, servers, and devices.</p>

		<p>Maybe a project over how to connect computers, devices, or servers to the internet or one another would be interesting</p>
